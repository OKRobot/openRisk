10703: Deep Reinforcement Learning
Spring 2018


This project attempts to learn "Risk" (board game) strategy through reinforcement learning methods.  

The risk_env file defines two classes:
map - which creates a user-defined Risk map from a .risk file
env - the environment which defines the states, actions, rewards, and transition function for any given map

The agent_simple class defines an agent to perform a basic policy in an environment
